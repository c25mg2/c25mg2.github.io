			I learned about keyframe animation, which I think is really cool but not very practical. It was pretty frustrating to write so much code to make the animation smooth. I linked that to my projects page. Now I know how to make the elevator door for my website as well.

			I'm starting really get the hang of the syntax of html and css. It is starting to feel natural which is really satisfying. I also have an idea for by digital present. I think I will make a Christmas card for my brother. I am starting to look into css animation on YouTube, so I can further work on my website when I finish the drawings.

			Iâ€™ve learned some basics about html and css and started to make my website. I hope to learn how to add some basic animation in javascript, and I am excited to draw the background elevator of my website. And because of that, I want to know how to use an image that is not on the internet.
