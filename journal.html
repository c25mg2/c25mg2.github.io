			entry("5/27/22", "I recently finished by final project. My idea was to use the elevator design of my website and have each floor be a significant codesketch. So, I copied the exact code from my website, but changed the iFrames on the floors to the codesketchs and the variables accordingly. I also added the extra buttons and changed their size so they would fit within the panel. For my website, in the future I hope to have a disable animations button because after a while they can get kind of annoying.");

				"I have spent a couple hours working on my website today and it is finally getting close to completion. I have now figured out how to make the whole thing scale when the window is resized. I used the calc() function in css to convert everything in terms of vh. Something I was not aware of is that one can use vh for the width. I honestly did this as a mistake, but it ended up working, and now I understand why it works. Because the height of the elevator car is always 100vh, all I needed to do was to scale everything in terms of the height. I figured out what the pixel values I needed when the window at a set size (1600 x 849px), and then used those ratios to scale everything down. Next, I needed to sort out how to position the elements. The y values were already correct because the car takes up 100vh, but the width was off because the amount of space to either side of the elevator car changes. So, I imagined that I cut off the excess space such the ratio of the window was the same as the set size I had figured out the positioning for. Then, I positioned the elements with the same percentage I had already figured out, but only for the width of that ratio rectangle. Then, I added the excess space back and it worked. A syntax thing to remember that caused me some trouble is that inside of an event listener, if one is calling a function, DO NOT put the parentheses. That caused me like 30 minutes of struggle."

I cannot seem to figure out why it is not centering on the final location of the ball. But it is always a constant distance away from where it should be, so that is a little promising."

				"I recently asked a friend to help me with my baseball simulator game, and he suggested that I restart because it is mom's spaghetti. I totally agree. So I just began restarting it, and already I have made some progress. Set up the strike zone and the intial location of the ball. I have also made the ball move, but it doesn't scale yet so it looks kind of weird."

				"I just came back from spring break and in class we made a clicker game as practice to get back in the habit of coding. I coded a little bit over break, but I still having a good amount of trouble remembering all of the syntax. The logic, which is most important, was still with me, but it was really frustrating to have to debug this relatively simple codesketch so many times. I also have began revistiting my website because currently it looks horrible. I just haven't had the chance to finish it. I finished the elevator car drawing a little while ago, and now I am trying to get it to center and scale when the window size is changed."

				"I just started learning the basics of p5.js. So far it looks to be pretty self-explanatory and not that difficult because coordinate systems and graphing are things that come pretty naturally to me. I started relatively simple and drew a football because today was the Super Bowl. I used bezier() to outline the football and stroke(), strokeWidth(), and fill() to style it. To draw the laces I used a for loop to draw the eight, evenly spaced lines."

				"For the last couple of weeks, I have been working on a baseball game for my data representation project. It will simulate an at bat, and the user can choose different speeds of the pitch ranging from Little League to the fastest recorded pitch in history. Around the random ball location, there is a timing circle that indicates when the user needs to click. Eventually I want to make the ball actually move and to have a background image of a baseball field in perspective. What I am working on right now is making an eventListener that will record how far away the user click was away from the ball and how long it took for the user to click, so I can calculate how whether or not it is swing and miss, ground ball, foul ball, homerun, etc."

				"After reading the article on color, I learned about the RGB and CMYK color systems. I had always known about RGB, but I never understood why there was green and not yellow because in art/pigments, yellow is a primary color, not green. But now I understand that RGB refers to light and not pigments. I also did not really know the difference between RGB and CMYK, but now I know that RBG is additive while CMYK is subtractive. In the Javascript article there was not much that I did not already know, but it was a nice refresher."

				"To debug code, a good first step is to look at the console for errors. Look at the content of the error and the line number to locate where the error is taking place. This will most things. If there are no syntax errors, then a next good step is to look at the part of code that is not doing what you intended. Look at parentheses, curly brackets, and misplaced variable names."

				"A varible is an object that holds information so we can call on it in an easier, organized, and compact way. A function is a set of instructions that we can similarly invoke in an easier, organized, and compact way. In order to invoke a function one must write the 'nameOfFunction();' with the necessary arguments. Some words I've learned in javascript so far are function, var, document.createElement(), document.createTextNode(), classList.add(), setInterval(), and appendChild(). In my codesketch a function is used to display an image and text every 5 seconds. I remade my journal and projects pages using functions, which was more interesting and difficult."
